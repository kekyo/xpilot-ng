.SS Command options

This section describes the options which may be specified only as
switches to the \fBxpilots\fP command.

For a list of all options, try \fBxpilots -help\fP.  See also sections
\fBDefaults file options\fP and \fBMap file options\fP.

.TP 15
.B -help 
Prints a short help, including the supported commandline options.

[\fIcommand\fP]
Without a parameter, this displays a brief message, listing the
supported commandline options.  Specifying a \fIcommand\fP displays
help for the command.

.TP 15
.B -version
Prints the current version.

.TP 15
.B -dump
Prints all options with their default values in \fBdefaults file\fP
format.

.TP 15
.B -defaultsFileName or defaults \fIstring\fP
The filename of the defaults file to read on startup.

.SS Defaults file options

This section describes the options which may be specified either as
command switches or in the \fBdefaults file\fP.

For a list of all options, try \fBxpilots -help\fP.  See also sections
\fBCommand options\fP and \fBMap file options\fP.

.TP 15
.B -passwordFileName \fIstring\fP
The filename of the password file to read on startup.  This file should
be protected against unwanted eyes with \fBchmod(1)\fP (e.g. chmod 600
password).

.TP 15
.B -robotFile \fIstring\fP
The file containing parameters for robot details.

.TP 15
.B -/+idleRun or rawMode 
Do robots keep on playing even if all human players quit?

If this option is specified, xpilots doesn't go to sleep when there are no
human players logged into the game.  The \fBnoquit\fP option must be
specified for this to have any effect after the first player joins the
game.

.TP 15
.B -/+noQuit
Does the server wait for new human players to show up
after all players have left.

If this option is specified, xpilots won't quit when the last human
player exits.

.TP 15
.B -/+logRobots
Log the comings and goings of robots.

.TP 15
.B -mapFileName or map \fIstring\fP
The filename of the map to use.
Or "wild" if you want a map by The Wild Map Generator.

This option allows you to select the map you will use for this server.  If
it is omitted, you will have to manage with a computer generated random
map.  For instructions on how to create a map, see below.
For example if 
.B -map fuzz2
or the equivalent
.B -map fuzz2.xp
is passed as command line arguments, the server will try to locate a file
called \fBfuzz2.xp\fP in the current directory, or in a predefined
directory (default is @XP_DATADIR@/maps/).

.TP 15
.B -contactPort or port \fIinteger\fP
The server contact port number.

.TP 15
.B -serverHost \fIstring\fP
The server's fully qualified domain name (for multihomed hosts).

Specifies to the meta server the FQDN (fully qualified domain name) of
the server.  This is helpful if the system has multiple identities and
one is preferred over the other.  Also, this option may be used to bind
xpilots to a specific IP number on \fImultihomed\fP hosts (hosts with
more than one IP number) such as virtual hosting sites.  Otherwise, the
default behaviour of xpilots is to listen to any IP number on the host
and to try by various methods, starting with the value returned by
\fBgethostname(2)\fP to determine the host's FQDN (fully qualified
domain name) and report that to the meta servers.

.TP 15
.B -/+reportToMetaServer or reportMeta
Keep the meta server informed about our game?

The default for xpilots is \fB-reportMeta\fP.  Specify \fB+reportMeta\fB
to suppress reporting the xpilots server to the xpilot meta server so
that other players on the Internet may find it.  This should be done
whenever a server is unreachable either due to a firewall that is not
configured to allow access to it, or when the connection to the server
is so poor that players on the Internet would not enjoy playing on it,
as is arguably the case with any dialup ISP connection.

.TP 15
.B -/+searchDomainForXPilot
Search the local domain for the existence of xpilot.domain?

.TP 15
.B -denyHosts \fIstring\fP
List of network addresses of computers which are denied service.
Each address may optionally be followed by a slash and a network mask.

.TP 15
.B -/+ignore20MaxFPS 
Ignore client maxFPS request if it is 20 (the default setting).

.TP 15
.B -motdFileName or motd \fIstring\fP
The filename of the MOTD file to show to clients when they join.

.TP 15
.B -scoreTableFileName or scoretable \fIstring\fP
The filename for the score table to be dumped to.

.TP 15
.B -/+pLockServer 
Whether the server is prevented from being swapped out of memory.

.TP 15
.B -timerResolution \fIinteger\fP
If set to nonzero xpilots will requests signals from the OS at
1/timerResolution second intervals.  The server will then compute
a new frame FPS times out of every timerResolution signals.

.TP 15
.B -password \fIstring\fP
The password needed to obtain operator privileges.

Allows operator privileges to be gained during a game by those who know
the password via commands typed in the client's message window.  See
the \fBMessage-window commands\fP section below.

Note that specifying this on the command line is not secure unless you
are the sole user of the host xpilots is started on, as \fBps(1)\fP may
be used to retrieve the options passed on the command-line when the
server was started.  A more secure way of starting a passworded server
is to set the password in the password file and protect the mapfile with
\fBchmod(1)\fP (e.g. chmod 600 password) to keep it private.

.TP 15
.B -clientPortStart \fIinteger\fP
Use UDP ports clientPortStart - clientPortEnd (for firewalls)

When the xpilots server is behind an IP masquerading or NAT firewall,
the UDP ports used for client connections (as distinct from the contact
port, which by default is 15345/udp) must be defined by the server, and
the firewall must be configured to forward the defined port range to the
xpilots server host.  Use this switch with \fB-clientPortEnd\fP to
define the range.  For example, start the server with \fBxpilots
-clientPortStart 40000 -clientPortEnd 40009\fP and on the firewall
redirect ports 40000/udp through 40009/udp to the host that xpilots is
running on.  One port must be reserved for each client, so reserve the
same number of ports as there are bases on the map.

.TP 15
.B -clientPortEnd \fIinteger\fP
Use UDP ports clientPortStart - clientPortEnd (for firewalls)

Used with \fB-clientPortStart\fR to reserve a range of UDP ports for
client connections.

.SS Map file options

This section describes the options which may be specified either in
the map file, in the \fBdefaults file\fP, or as command line switches.

For a list of all options, try \fBxpilots -help\fP.  See also sections
\fBCommand options\fP and \fBDefaults file options\fP.

.TP 15
.B -robots \fInumber\fP
Tells the server that you want \fInumber\fP robots instead of the default -
number-of-bases/2.  A value of -1 will fill the entire server with robots.
Note however that there will always be room for one new player, the robots
will be kicked out of the game to accomodate for new players, they will
also enter the game when there is space for them.


.SS Prompt options (owner only)
If you are the owner of a server you have successfully connected to (with
\fIxpilot(6)\fP), you have several special commands available, all of which
applies to the current server only:
.TP 15
.B m
Send a message to the players.
.TP 15
.B k
Kick a player out of the game.  Currently, this command does not stop the
player from re-joining the game.  Hopefully, however, he or she would have
learned their lesson.
.TP 15
.B l
Lock/unlock the game.  This prevents other users from joining the game.
.TP 15
.B d
Shutdown/cancel shutdown.  This command will ask for a reason and a
shutdown delay (in seconds) and transmit these to the server.  A timer will
appear showing how much time is left before the game goes down.  If you
don't specify a delay, you will be canceling an already initiated shutdown.

.SS Message-window commands
The server now supports commands typed via the client's message window
while in the game.  This provides a more convenient way to communicate
with the server than the old command-prompt interface, as it does not
require the user to leave the game window to operate the controls.

All such message-window commands start with the slash (/) character.
These are divided into two groups, those which can be typed by ordinary
players and those which are only accessible to operators who have first
supplied the correct password with the \fB/password\fR message-window
command.  If a password is not set on the server by the owner, the
operator commands are not usable.

Where a \fIname\fP is specified in the following commands, only leading
characters in the name need to be typed.  If two names start with the
same characters, type as many characters as are needed to uniquely identify
the player.

.TP 15
.B Player message-window commands
.RS 5

.TP 15
.B /help [\fIcommand\fP]
Without a parameter, this displays a brief message, listing the
supported commandline options.  Specifying \fB/help\fP \fIcommand\fP
displays brief help for the command.

.TP 15
.B /team \fInumber\fP
Swaps you to the specified team \fInumber\fP.

.TP 15
.B /queue
Show the names of the players waiting on the queue to enter the game.
See also \fB/advance\fP.

.TP 15
.B /version
Displays the server version number.

.RS -5

.TP 15
.B Operator message-window commands
.RS 5

.TP 15
.B /password \fIpassword\fP
When the correct password is given, the player is granted operator privilege
for the server.  Subsequently, any of the other operator commands listed
here may be executed by the player.

.TP 15
.B /advance \fIname\fR
Moves the named player to the front of the queue.  See also \fB/queue\fP.

.TP 15
.B /kick \fIname\fR
Kicks the named player from the game.

.TP 15
.B /lock [\fIvalue\fR]
Without a parameter, this displays the lock status of the game.
Specify \fB/lock 0\fR to unlock the game or \fB/lock 1\fR to lock
the game so that no more players may enter.

.TP 15
.B /pause \fIname\fR
Pauses the named player.

.TP 15
.B /reset [all]
Resets the current round number to 1.  If \fB/reset all\fP is
specified, all scores are set to 0 as well.

.TP 15
.B /set \fIoption value\fR
Sets the named \fIoption\fR to the specified \fIvalue\fR.  Note that some
server options cannot be changed at runtime.  The server will notify
you if you cannot change a value, or if you specify an invalid value.
