====                       XPilot NG Change Log                            ====
===============================================================================

This is a summary of changes of release 4.7.3 compared to release 4.7.2.

Common:
	* OpenAL has split alut into a separate library, freealut.  Configure
	  now checks for both libraries and will not work with OpenAL versions
	  prior to the split.   OpenAL 0.0.8 and freealut 1.0.1 have been
	  tested and work.

Server:
	* Fix unpause when baselessPausing is on.
	* Improved signal handling.
	* Revert to the old policy of allowing players to "steal" bases
	  from teammates regardless of score.
	* Added the playerCollisionFuelDrain option (default 100):
	  How much fuel does a player collision cost?
	* Generate nicer rank webpages in valid XHTML 1.0 Strict.
	* Add the -rankWebpageCSS option to support custom style sheets
	  for the rank webpages.
	* Don't pause players for idling while they are waiting or appearing.

Client:
	* Improved ball message scan.  Clear color attributes of
	  out-of-date ball messages.
	* Fix a bug that made it impossible to lose items.
	* Minimum value for hudRadarLimit option changed from 0 to 0.05
	  because at 0, a randomly flashing dot will be drawn on top of
	  the ship in the center of screen.
	* Rename textinterface.c function readline() to read_line().
	  Otherwise it will not build with eglibc 2.10 which always defines
	  readline, since it became a standard in POSIX2008.

X11 Client only:
	* Improve shipshape rendering by fixing some rounding errors.
	* Fix bug that prevented radar colors from being set from xpilotrc.
	* Remove window title flipping.

XPilot NG XP-Replay:
	* Disable some code in color allocation function, it breaks certain
	  recordings.
	* Space key now toggles pause.

Maps:
	* Provide only one version polybloods map, namely that used at the
	  Chaos server (v8T2).  Call it v9.

===============================================================================

This is a summary of changes of release 4.7.2 compared to release 4.7.1.

XPilot NG Control Center:
        * Some usability improvements.

SDL & X11 Client:
	* Renamed option sounds to soundFile.
	* Added boolean option sound which can be used to enable/disable the
	  sound without changing the value of the maxVolume option. Default
	  is true if sound has been compiled into the client.
	* Added option keyToggleSound which toggles the value of option
	  sound. It has no default value.
	* When using X11, only warn about Emulate3Buttons, don't disable it.

SDL Client only:
	* Fixed some memory leaks, e.g. one for HUD messages.
	* Texture bug fixes, should fix the bug in 4.7.1 where the
	  ship is painted as a white box on some machines.

X11 Client only:
	* Configure options --enable-dbe and --enable-mbx should work again.

Server:
	* Put back the old behaviour that dropped mines are immune to gravity.
	  Explanation is that they are "anchored" to the map the same way
	  as the walls are.
	* New option ballCollisionDetaches (default false):
	  Does a ball get freed by a collision with a player?
	* New option playerBallBounceBrakeFactor (default 0.7):
	  Elastic or inelastic properties of the player-ball collision,
	  1 means fully elastic, 0 fully inelastic.

XPilot NG XP-Replay:
        * A fix so that big old recordings don't slow down to a crawl.
	* Possibility to jump forward in a recording by pressing number keys:
	  the number pressed tells how many minutes to forward.

===============================================================================
	
This is a summary of changes of release 4.7.1 compared to release 4.7.0.

Server: 
	* Bugfix: Gives feedback when player tries to unpause too soon
	  after pausing.

SDL Client: 
	* Bugfix: unpausing with menu works more than twice.
	* Redesign: The Join/Pause menu works a lot differently, since it
	  checks the player's pause status.
	
===============================================================================
	
This is a summary of changes of release 4.7.0 compared to release 4.6.6.

Common:

* Support for MinGW/MSys build environment on windows, now the the server
  can also be built on Windows.
* XPilot NG network protocol is extended so that polygon styles can be
  changed during the game. This feature can then be used to make e.g.
  polygon cannons disappear when destroyed.
* Shipshape code removes 0 length edges from ships, making bugs and weird
  features less likely e.g. in the ship wall bounce code.


xp to xp2 map converter (mapconvert.py):

* Support for more map elements


XPilot NG Control Center:

* New super elegant user interface for XPilot NG written in python. It
  can launch all other XPilot NG programs. In the Windows binary distribution,
  this is used by default. On other platforms it is 'contrib' software, that
  is players can use it if they want.


Maps:

* Added maps:
  - blood-music.xp2
  - circle2.xp2
  - dodgers-legacy.xp2
  - dodgers-robots.xp2
  - ndh.xp2: New default map
  - spaceball-0.1.xp2
  - spaceball-0.2.xp2
  - tourmination.xp2


Client:

* New option: clientDirPrediction: the client tries to guess the current
  direction of the ship in the server, which reduces apparent lag.
* Stuck keys bug fixed which caused e.g. "shield bug", i.e. that shield
  won't go down any more automatically when firing.
* New options: keyExit, keyYes, keyNo: now one can quit by pressing keyExit
  (Escape by default), the client will ask for confirmation
* Code to disable and/or warn about X emulate3buttons, which can cause
  delays and lost shots and thrust when mouse steering is used.
* Client displays client lag, that is time to draw a frame.
* Ability to paint messages above hud in white color (used for newbie messags
  and quit (y/n) ? message).
* Fix bug in texturePath handling with caused paths like
  polybloods/.../polybloods/.
* Activate mouse steering by clicking background with left mouse button.
* Don't bother announce if robot declares war or seeks some player.
* Removed option selectionAndHistory.
* No keyboard turning configured by default.
* Arrow keys handle locking on players like in XPilot 4.5.4.
* Faster drawing of non-wrapping polygon maps.
* Shot textures up to size 16 (previous max was 8).


X11 client:

* Polygon radar bug which was visible on ndh.xp2 and dragon map fixed.
* Option teamShipColor changes the color of friendly ships.


SDL/OpenGL client:

* Hover widgets used to display help for options in configure menu.
* Cut and paste support for messages.
* Join menu can be used to swap the team instead of using a /team N server
  command.
* TexturedShips option, default true
* Option teamShipColorRGBA changes the color of friendly ships.
* Option decorColorRGBA and decor support on block maps
* Paint targets on block maps
* Support for polygon "internal" edges: they are not drawn
* Paint hidden wall edges if walls are painted unfilled
* Changed some color defaults: better visible messages, meters and ship names
* Paint items on HUD correctly


Server:

* Configure with --enable-select-sched to enable code that gives more correct
  server FPS on Linux 2.6
* Turnpush code which makes ship push itself away from a wall if turning
  hits the wall
* Some server optimizations, e.g. less memory is used for shots and objects.
* Objects of all types are now warped by wormholes.
* Added /shutdown command.
* More realistic sparks: faster and lighter.
* Possibility to pause when ship is appearing on base.
* More accurate compatibility mode for block (old) clients playing on
  polygon maps.
* Score by survival time (test map: circle.xp2)
* Don't allow players to steal bases from teammates with higher score.
* Don't clear pausers' scores when doing /reset all.
* Allow activating normal pause in an area of radius of 1.5 blocks around base.
  Previously one had to be in the exact block where the base is.
  If player is too far away, attempt to activate hoverpause.
* Allow changing base in an area of radius of 1.5 blocks around base.
* Allow player to fly at very slow speed at 0 fuel to reach some refuel
  station using very last "drops" of fuel.

* Added server options:
  - initial item options for cannons
  - treasureCollisionKills
  - ballCollisionFuelDrain
  - maxSparkWallBounceSpeed
  - playerWallBounceType
  - cannonsPickupItems
  - cannonShotSpeed
  - minCannonShotLife
  - maxCannonShotLife
  - survivalScore
  - zeroSumScoring
  - turnPushPersistence
  - turnGrip
  - thrustWidth
  - thrustMass
  - sparkSpeed
  - deadFramesPerSecond: Maximum FPS sent to client when player is in dead state

* Removed server options:
  - robotLeaveScore
  - robotLeaveRatio,
  - robotTicksPerSecond: Robots are updated once per tick (game time unit)
  - silent
  - cannonsUseItems: Cannons now always use items if they have any
  - cannonsDefend: They always defend if they can
  - teamShareScore
  - asteroidPoints
  - cannonPoints,
  - asteroidMaxScore
  - cannonMaxScore
  - maraWallBounce: Use playerWallBounceType instead

* Possibility to specify base orders in xp2 maps: a lower value for order
  will mean players will first get that base if they join the team, check
  polybloods.xp2 map for an example

* Support for "fixed" wormholes in xp2 maps.
  Syntax for such is like in this example:

  <Wormhole x="59120" y="240160" type="fixed">
  <Polygon x="168000" y="439040" style="scary">
  <Offset x="4240" y="0"/><Offset x="0" y="4240"/>
  <Offset x="-4240" y="0"/><Offset x="0" y="-4240"/>
  </Polygon>
  </Wormhole>

  The x and y values in a fixed wormhole tell to what destination objects will
  be warped. The polygon defines the area your ship must hit for you to get
  warped

* Possibility to specify some options for individual cannons on xp2 maps.
  Values of these will override general map options where appropriate.
  Supported options are initial item options, cannonsmartess (0-3)
  and cannonshotspeed.
  An example cannon would look like this: 	 
  	 
         <Cannon x="7467" y="283360" dir="0"> 	 
         <Option name="initiallasers" value="4"/> 	 
         <Option name="initialemergencyshields" value="1"/> 	 
         <Option name="cannonsmartness" value="3"/> 	 
         <Polygon x="7467" y="283360" style="emptywhite"> 	 
         <Style state="destroyed" id="invisible"/> 	 
         <Offset x="-747" y="1120"/> 	 
         <Offset x="0" y="-2240"/> 	 
         <Offset x="747" y="1120"/> 	 
         </Polygon></Cannon>

xpilot-ng-xp-mapedit: xp (block based) map editor for unix (renamed xp-mapedit)

===============================================================================

This is a summary of changes of release 4.5.4X compared to release 4.5.4.

===============================================================================

This is a summary of changes of release 4.3.1X compared to release 4.3.1.

An evil buffer overflow bug has been fixed in the server.

VMS is no longer supported since nobody took care of it.
The default installation path has been changed.

Two new client options (user, host). Patch by Paul Alexander Drees. This
allows you to specify the user@host on the command line or in your .xpilotrc.

New client option messagesToStdout for players that want player messages (and
optionally status messages) to go to standard output. (Thorsten Kroeger)

Player passwords support. Several new server options: allowPlayerPasswords
(-PlayerPasswords), playerPasswordsFileName and playerPasswordsFileSizeLimit
(-playerPasswordsFile and -playerPasswordsLimit). Passwords are disabled by
default. Default file name is LIBDIR/player_passwords. Default limit is
1 megabyte (file may grow a little bigger than the limit!). (Thorsten Kroeger)

Regarding the player passwords support, have a look at the new commands
/setpass and /auth.

A minor bug has been fixed that would cause the client not to work properly
if it fixed the nick name at startup. It also wouldn't work correctly with
the newly implemented password support. This fix implies a new MAGIC version.
(Thorsten)
